Module "LED_Red"   (component LED)
   - LED_Red_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED_Red_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED_Red_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED_Red_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED_Red_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED_Red_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off 
                pins, values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LED_Red_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED_Red_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "LED_Green" (component LED)
   - LED_Green_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED_Green_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED_Green_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED_Green_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED_Green_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED_Green_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off 
                pins, values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LED_Green_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED_Green_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "LED_Blue"  (component LED)
   - LED_Blue_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED_Blue_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED_Blue_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED_Blue_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED_Blue_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED_Blue_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off 
                pins, values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - LED_Blue_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED_Blue_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL25Z128LK4)
